<h1>Personal Chef</h1>

<p>This Android app suggests recipes to users by considering what the user has in his or her refrigerator. I plan to use the Spoonacular Food API for recipes, ingredient searching, and specifically the endpoint for recipe search by ingredients. I also plan to use a database to store information about the users.

<p>This project is useful and unique because many people enjoy trying new foods, and my app will help them conveniently find new and relevant recipes to follow, hopefully preventing them from cooking the same old recipes every day. Sometimes people are also faced with the problem of figuring out what they can make with what they have. My app will help them know what foods they can cook with the ingredients they own. In the future as our phones can connect directly to our refrigerators, I hope my app will become more applicable and more integrated with everyday technologies like smart refrigerators.

<p>I plan to use tabs/swipe views for navigation and have up to four views:
<p>My Refrigerator
<p>Suggested Recipes (kind of food)
<p>Favorite Recipes (if I have time)
<p>Shopping list (if I have time)
