<h1>Personal Chef</h1>

<p>This Android app suggests recipes to the users based off of what they already have in their refrigerator. I plan to use the Spoonacular Food API for recipes and ingredients and a database to store information about the users.

<p>This project is useful and unique because many people enjoy trying new foods, so my app will help others conveniently find new and relevant recipes to make hopefully preventing them from cooking the same old recipes every day. Sometimes people are also faced with the problem of figuring out what they can make with what they have. My app will help them know what foods they can cook with the ingredients they own. In the future as our phones can connect directly to our refrigerators, I hope my app will become more applicable and more integrated with everyday technologies like smart refrigerators.

<p>I plan to use tabs for navigation and have four views:
<p>My Refrigerator
<p>Suggested Recipes (kind of food)
<p>Favorite Recipes
<p>Shopping list
